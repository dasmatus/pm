//! Starting the machine with a program a [`Launcher`] names, instead of starting
//! QEMU directly.
//!
//! A launcher is asked once per boot, with the machine already laid out in its
//! directory: the initramfs, a private copy of the kernel, and the status socket pm
//! listens on. It answers with a program, its arguments and any files to write
//! next to those - a domain definition, say - or with nothing, which leaves the
//! machine to QEMU. pm then holds the program to three rules, and that is the whole
//! contract:
//!
//! * **It lives exactly as long as the machine.** pm waits for it to exit and
//!   counts the machine as stopped when it does, so a program that starts a
//!   machine and returns would stop the wait early, and one that outlives its
//!   machine would hold `pm run` up.
//! * **It owns the console.** It gets pm's terminal when pm has one, and otherwise
//!   a pseudo-terminal pm copies to and from its own stdin and stdout, so a
//!   program that insists on a terminal works under a pipe too.
//! * **The guest's second serial port goes to the status socket.** Init reports
//!   how the entrypoint exited there, as it does under QEMU started by pm, and
//!   that report, not the program's exit status, is what `pm run` returns.
//!
//! The program may run QEMU as another user, as libvirt's system daemon does. So
//! the directory is made searchable but not listable, and every file in it is
//! private to its owner: whoever runs QEMU has to be handed each file it opens,
//! which is what libvirt does for the kernel, the initramfs and the sockets. And
//! the program is told to stop (`SIGTERM`) if pm dies first, so a machine whose
//! caller went away does not keep running.
