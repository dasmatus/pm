//! Packages that ship their own kernel, and booting them in a virtual machine.
//!
//! A recipe can declare `kernel = kernel(image = "boot/vmlinuz")`. The build checks
//! that its install steps staged a Linux kernel image at that package-relative
//! path, and the package metadata records it as a [`Kernel`]. `pm run` then boots
//! that kernel in a QEMU virtual machine and runs the chosen entrypoint as the
//! guest's only program, instead of running it in the namespace jail on the host's
//! kernel. `pm run --host-kernel` keeps the jail.
//!
//! # What the guest sees
//!
//! The guest's root filesystem is an initramfs pm assembles for each run ([`boot`]):
//!
//! * the extracted package at `/pkg`, minus the kernel image itself;
//! * the host's loader and shared libraries the package's binaries link, at their
//!   host paths, taken only from the system directories the run jail mirrors
//!   ([`closure`]);
//! * pm's guest [`init`](guest) - `pm-vm-init` from beside `pm`, or `pm` itself -
//!   with its own libraries;
//! * `/dev/console`, `/dev/null` and the two serial ports, and empty `/proc`,
//!   `/sys` and `/tmp` that init mounts.
//!
//! Nothing else from the host is there: no `/etc`, no `/home`, no host `/tmp`. The
//! machine has no network device and no disk. The landlock profile a package
//! records is not applied inside the guest, because there is nothing outside the
//! package and its libraries for it to deny; the VM boundary replaces it.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! * **Other architectures.** Only x86-64 hosts boot a package kernel today, with
//!   two 16550 serial ports on QEMU's `pc` machine. Other hosts refuse with an
//!   error; `--host-kernel` still runs the package.
//! * **Network.** The guest has no NIC, and `--network` is refused rather than
//!   silently ignored.
//! * **Auditing.** `--audit` traces a host process with `ptrace`, which cannot see
//!   into a VM, so it is refused too.
//! * **Confining QEMU.** QEMU runs as the calling user, outside any jail. The
//!   package's code only ever runs inside the guest.
//! * **Trusting the exit status.** Init reports how the entrypoint exited on the
//!   second serial port. Code running in the guest could write to that port too, so
//!   the status is the package's claim about itself, not a measurement.
//!
//! # What the kernel needs
//!
//! An initramfs, an 8250/16550 serial console and ELF binaries for the host's
//! architecture, all built in rather than as modules: nothing in the guest loads
//! modules. Distribution "generic" and "virtual" kernels have all three.
