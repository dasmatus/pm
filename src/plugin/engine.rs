//! The WebAssembly runtime a plugin is confined to.
//!
//! pm runs plugins **inside its own process**, which is the one place in this crate
//! where there is no jail, no `landlock` and no separate address space to fall back on:
//! the WebAssembly sandbox is the whole boundary. Everything in this module exists to
//! make that boundary worth trusting.
//!
//! # What a plugin is given
//!
//! One import, `pm:plugin/host.log`, which takes a level and a string and returns
//! nothing. That is the entire host surface. There is no WASI: no files, no clock, no
//! randomness, no network, no environment, no arguments, no `proc_exit`. A component
//! that imports anything else fails to instantiate, by construction rather than by
//! check - [`Runtime::linker`] only ever has `log` defined on it, and wasmtime refuses
//! an instantiation whose imports it cannot satisfy.
//!
//! Because `log` returns nothing, no information flows *into* the guest through it.
//! A plugin's answer is therefore a function of its own bytes and the argument it was
//! called with, and of nothing else - which is what lets a plugin's identity be folded
//! into the build policy digest in [`super::Registry::digest`] and mean something.
//!
//! # What a plugin is denied
//!
//! * **Time.** Every call is metered with [`FUEL`] units, and running out is a trap.
//!   Fuel counts executed instructions, so this is a hard bound on work rather than a
//!   timeout - and, unlike an epoch deadline, it is deterministic: the same call on the
//!   same input traps at the same instruction on every machine. A plugin cannot hang a
//!   build.
//! * **Memory.** [`MEMORY_BYTES`] caps linear memory and [`TABLE_ELEMENTS`] the tables,
//!   through wasmtime's [`StoreLimits`]. A growth request past the cap fails inside the
//!   guest, as an allocation failure, rather than taking the machine down with it.
//! * **Stack.** [`STACK_BYTES`] bounds recursion; past it the call traps.
//! * **Company.** One instance per store, and a fresh store per call - see
//!   [`Runtime::enter`].
//!
//! # A fresh store per call
//!
//! Each call gets a new [`Store`] and therefore a new instance with zero-initialised
//! memory. It costs an instantiation per call, which is microseconds against a
//! tree-sitter parse or a compiler invocation, and it buys the property that makes
//! plugin answers reviewable: **nothing carries between calls**. One build file's
//! commands cannot influence how the next one is classified, and one source file cannot
//! influence the grants derived from another. A plugin that wants to accumulate state
//! has nowhere to put it.
//!
//! The compiled [`Component`], which is the expensive part, is built once per plugin at
//! load time and shared across every call and every thread.
