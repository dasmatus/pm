//! pm's build core: build files, their dependency graph, the plugins and policy
//! that classify their steps, the sandbox they run in, and the permissions a
//! package is found to need.
//!
//! The layers below that core are crates of their own under `crates/`, and are
//! re-exported here under the module names they always had, so `pm::signing`,
//! `pm::wire` and the rest still resolve.
