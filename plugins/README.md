# Writing a pm plugin

A pm plugin is a **WebAssembly component**. pm loads every `*.wasm` in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pm/plugins/` (or `$HOME/.config/pm/plugins/`) and calls it to
answer the two questions its own built-in tables cannot always answer:

| hook               | question                                                                  | what pm does without it                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `classify-command` | what does this build-step command need from the build jail?               | refuses to build, naming the command           |
| `scan-source`      | what does this source file imply the built program needs at run time?     | contributes nothing for file types it cannot parse |

The interface is `wit/plugin.wit` at the repository root. Read it first; it is
the contract, and it is commented.

## The sandbox

A plugin runs **inside pm's own process**. There is no jail around it, because
pm is the thing doing the jailing, so the WebAssembly sandbox is the entire
boundary. What that boundary is:

* **One import.** `pm:plugin/host.log`, which takes a level and a string and
  returns nothing. That is the whole host surface. There is **no WASI**: no
  files, no clock, no randomness, no network, no environment, no arguments, no
  `proc_exit`. A component that imports anything else does not instantiate.
* **A fuel budget per call.** Fuel counts executed instructions, so it bounds
  work rather than time, and it is deterministic - the same call on the same
  input traps at the same instruction on every machine. A plugin cannot hang a
  build.
* **A memory cap, a table cap and a stack cap.**
* **A fresh instance per call.** Nothing carries between calls: one build file's
  commands cannot influence how the next is classified, and one source file
  cannot influence the grants derived from another.

Because `log` returns nothing, no information flows *into* a plugin through it.
A plugin's answer is a function of its own bytes and its argument, and of
nothing else - which is what lets pm fold the plugin set into a build policy's
digest and have that mean something.

## What a plugin may and may not change

* It is **only asked about commands pm's own table did not match**. No plugin
  can decide that `cargo` needs no network or that `git` is not version
  control, because no plugin is ever asked.
* It **publishes a ceiling** in its manifest, and pm drops any capability a
  verdict asks for outside it. The ceiling is the plugin's own claim, enforced;
  its value is that reading `pm plugins` is a cheap substitute for reading the
  plugin. It is not a defence against a key you should not have trusted.
* Its fingerprints are recorded as `<plugin>:<name>`, so `pm explain` shows who
  classified what. Its run-time grants carry `plugin` provenance and an
  evidence line naming it, so `pm profile` shows who asked for what.
* Its grants land in a profile recorded in **audit mode**, exactly like pm's
  own signals. Nothing on the build path turns enforcement on.
* A plugin that traps, runs out of fuel or answers with something unusable is
  logged and treated as having had no answer. It cannot fail a build to spite
  you.

## Symbols: values a build file can use

Beside the two hooks, a plugin publishes **symbols** — named constants a build file
substitutes into a step command as `%{<plugin>:<name>}`:

```yaml
run:
  - install -Dm644 demo.service %{systemd:unitdir}/demo.service
  - install -Dm644 demo.conf %{systemd:tmpfilesdir}/demo.conf
```

The point is what a build file would otherwise hardcode and get wrong. Where unit
files go is a fact about systemd, not about your package, and digging it out of
`pkg-config --variable=systemdsystemunitdir systemd` needs pkg-config *and* systemd's
development files inside the build jail to answer. `pm plugins` prints every symbol
every installed plugin offers.

They are constants, not computed values: a plugin has no filesystem, no environment and
no clock, so there is nothing to compute one *from*. The list is fixed in the component
and pm reads it once, at load, which is also what makes it reviewable.

### What a symbol may and may not do to a command

A symbol changes **what command runs**, which is a larger power than anything else a
plugin has — classification only decides what a command may reach. Two rules bound it,
and between them a symbol can do exactly one thing: fill in part of an argument the
build file already wrote out.

- **A value is one word.** Commands are split on whitespace and handed to `execve` with
  no shell in between, so a value containing whitespace would not fill an argument in,
  it would *add* arguments. pm drops any value holding whitespace, a control character
  or a NUL at load, and a build file naming a dropped symbol then fails loudly.
- **A symbol may not be the program.** A reference in a command's first word is refused.
  The first word is what the fingerprint table classifies and what the jail resolves and
  execs; a plugin choosing that is a different power from a plugin describing it.

And it cannot hide. Expansion happens *after* the build file's signature is checked and
*before* the policy is derived, so the jail is always sized for the command that runs,
`pm explain` prints both the expanded commands and the symbols that shaped them, and
the expanded text feeds the policy digest. The author signed `%{systemd:unitdir}`, not
whatever that is today — the effective command is the product of two separately signed
things, the build file and the plugin, and neither alone decides it.

### What is and is not a reference

`%{…}` is a reference **only** when what is inside is a well-formed `plugin:symbol` —
a plugin name, one colon, a symbol name, both lower-case. A well-formed reference that
names nothing is an error, so a mistyped `%{systemd:unitdirr}` fails rather than
installing into a directory named after the typo.

Anything else keeps its shape: `%{NAME}` has no colon, `printf %s` and `100%%` have no
brace. There is no escape character because there is nothing to escape — a string that
is not shaped like a reference is already literal. The one cost is that a command cannot
contain a literal `%{` that *is* shaped like a reference.

Symbols are not substituted into `dl_urls`. A download's identity is its URL and its
hash, both of which the build file states; and `%` already means something in a URL.

## Trust

**A plugin must be signed**, by a key in the same trust store that governs build
files, or pm refuses to load it:

```sh
pm sign  ~/.config/pm/plugins/zig.wasm         # writes zig.wasm.sig
pm trust <the signer's public key hex>         # once, per key
```

`--allow-unsigned-plugins` skips the check. It is for a plugin you are writing
and have not signed yet. A build file names commands that run inside a jail; a
plugin *is* code that runs inside pm and helps decide what that jail allows, so
the escape hatch gives up rather more here than it does there.

`--no-plugins` loads none at all, which is the honest way to find out whether a
plugin is responsible for a surprising policy.

## Building one

The crates here are a separate cargo workspace, so `cargo build` at the
repository root never drags a `wasm32` target in.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
./build.sh              # everything, into dist/, and refresh the test fixtures
./build.sh zig          # just one
```

Two steps happen inside: `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` produces
a **core module**, and then `encoder/` wraps it into a component.
`wasm-tools component new` does the same job if you have it installed;
`encoder/` exists so `build.sh` needs nothing but a Rust toolchain.

A plugin of your own, in outline:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wit-bindgen = { version = "0.51", default-features = false, features = ["macros", "realloc"] }
```

```rust
wit_bindgen::generate!({ path: "path/to/pm/wit", world: "plugin" });

use pm::plugin::types::{Capability, Hook};

struct MyPlugin;

impl Guest for MyPlugin {
    fn describe() -> Manifest { /* name, version, summary, hooks, ceiling, extensions, symbols */ }
    fn classify_command(command: String) -> Option<Verdict> { /* ... */ }
    fn scan_source(file: SourceFile) -> Vec<Grant> { /* ... */ }
}

export!(MyPlugin);
```

Both exports are mandatory - the component model has no optional export - but
pm calls a hook only when `describe` lists it, so the one you do not implement
returns `None` or an empty `Vec`.

`Manifest`, `Verdict`, `Grant` and `SourceFile` are re-exported into the crate
root because the world's own functions name them; `Capability`, `Permission`,
`Hook` and `Symbol` are reached through `pm::plugin::types`.

Any language with a component toolchain works. Nothing about the interface is
Rust-specific; Rust is simply what these examples are written in.

## What is here

| crate         | what it is                                                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `zig/`        | classifies `zig` commands and reads `.zig` sources                        |
| `systemd/`    | classifies systemd tooling, reads unit files, publishes the install dirs  |
| `sysupdate/`  | classifies `systemd-sysupdate` and reads its transfer definitions         |
| `sysext/`     | classifies the system-extension image toolchain; one hook, on purpose     |
| `unitfile/`   | the unit-file parser the three systemd plugins share - an ordinary lib    |
| `encoder/`    | core module → component, so `build.sh` needs no `cargo install`           |
| `fixtures/*`  | deliberately badly behaved plugins, for `tests/plugins.rs`                |

The fixtures are the interesting reading if you want to know what pm does when
a plugin misbehaves: `greedy` asks for more than it published, `runaway` never
returns, `nameless` cannot be attributed, `wasi` wants more of the host than pm
lends anybody, and `scanner` contributes run-time grants from a file type pm has
no grammar for.

## Three things the systemd plugins are worth reading for

**A declaration beats a heuristic.** pm's own source analysis reads a syntax
tree looking for calls that *imply* a permission, and its module documentation
lists six things it cannot see. A `.service` unit needs none of that: it is the
author saying, in a vocabulary that lines up almost one-for-one with pm's
`Permission`, where the writes go and what gets executed. That precision buys
something a source scanner can never have - **negative** information.
`PrivateNetwork=yes` does not merely fail to suggest network access, it denies
it, so `systemd/` drops every network grant it derived from the same file. Not
finding a `socket()` call never means there is not one.

**Claim a generic extension, then gate on content.** `sysupdate/` reads `.conf`
files, an extension a source tree is full of. It looks for a `[Transfer]`
section before it records anything, and produces nothing at all for a `.conf`
belonging to something else. Any plugin claiming a generic extension should do
the same - a plausible-looking wrong grant is worse than no grant.

**Refusing is a legitimate answer.** `systemd/` recognises `systemd-nspawn`,
`systemd-run` and `machinectl` and then declines to classify them; `sysext/`
does the same for `mkosi` and `debootstrap`. Each runs something of its own
choosing, so a verdict would size a jail for a program nobody has read. pm's
answer to an unclassified command is a diagnostic naming it, and `--permissive`
is still there for a human who has decided. A plugin that classified everything
it saw would publish a ceiling wide enough to make `pm plugins` useless.

`sysext/` is also the example of a **single-hook** plugin: a `systemd-repart`
definition says how an image is assembled at build time, which is not what
`scan-source` asks about, so it declares only `classify-command` and its
`scan-source` export is never reached.

## On writing a good `scan-source`

The reference plugin matches over a token stream with comments and string
literals removed. That is the least a scanner can do to be honest, and it is
still a long way short of what pm does for the languages it knows: pm's own
queries in `src/perms/source.rs` match against a *syntax tree*, which is how
`fopen(path, "a")` becomes a write and `fopen(path, "r")` a read, decided from
the same call node rather than from what happened to be nearby.

Nothing in the plugin interface stops you doing as well. A component can carry
a whole parser - tree-sitter grammars compile to WebAssembly - and the fuel and
memory budgets are sized for a real one. The reference plugin is small because
it is an example, not because that is the ceiling.
