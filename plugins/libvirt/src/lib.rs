//! A pm plugin that boots a package's own kernel through libvirt.
//!
//! A package built with `kernel = kernel(image = ...)` runs in a virtual machine. pm
//! starts QEMU for it itself unless a `vm-plugin` answers first; this one answers
//! with `virsh create`, so the machine is libvirt's: it shows up in `virsh list` and
//! virt-manager while it runs, under the title `pm run: <entrypoint>`, and QEMU runs
//! wherever libvirt runs it, as its own user in the system daemon, confined by its
//! security driver.
//!
//! # Why `virsh create --console --autodestroy`
//!
//! pm's launcher contract is that the program lives exactly as long as the machine
//! and owns its console (see `pm_vm::launch`). This one command does both:
//!
//! * `create` starts a transient domain from the XML written beside the machine, so
//!   nothing is left defined once it stops.
//! * `--console` attaches to the guest's first serial port and returns when the
//!   guest powers off, which is what pm's init does once the entrypoint exits.
//! * `--autodestroy` ties the domain to virsh's connection, so if virsh dies - pm
//!   sends it `SIGTERM` when pm dies - libvirt destroys the machine rather than
//!   leaving it running with nobody attached.
//!
//! virsh connects where libvirt's own rules say: `LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI` when it is
//! set, otherwise `qemu:///system` for root and for anyone polkit lets manage it, and
//! `qemu:///session` for everyone else. The plugin passes no `-c`, so whichever
//! libvirt the user already drives virt-manager with is the one pm uses.
//!
//! The plugin only writes XML. It reaches nothing: like every pm plugin it runs in a
//! metered WebAssembly instance whose one import is `log`, and the one program it can
//! make pm run is `virsh`, which `pm plugins` prints.
